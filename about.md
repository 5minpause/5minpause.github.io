You have software. Somewhere there's always software. You either write it
yourself, or somebody did it for you. Or you're in the middle of a software
project. Lots of project are run by capable people delivering real value and
finishing projects on time and in the agreed-on budget.

But sometimes they don't.

Projects run late. It get's more expensive. There dissonance in the team about
the architecture or even about smaller things.

But it doesn't have to be that way. There are IT projects that are finished on
time, on budget, with minimal stress and sometimes even fun :=)

At least that's how most of my projects went during the last 10+ years. And
that's how our project can go if we work together.

I am Holger Frohloff and I do Ruby on Rails and ReactJS projects with my
clients. I live in Berlin with my wife, two daughters and our cat.

Most of the time I look a lot like this:
